# MITx_6.00.1x_Introduction_to_Computer_Science
My solutions to the problem sets for MITx: 6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python, EdX. The class was taught by Professor Eric Grimson, MIT Computer Science

All code in this course uses Python 3.7.3x.

Note these are not the most efficient solutions. They will, however, serve as an example of one way to approach the problems.
